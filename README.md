Project: Virtual Community Space

Overview:
In this project, I created a virtual community space with an interactive interface that allows users to explore events by location. The user should be able to click on one of at least four locations and view events that have occurred or will occur there.

Some features in this project:
- The web app uses React to display data from the API.
- The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured events table.
- The web app displays the title of the app.
- A visual interface allows the user to select a location they would like to view.
- Clicking on a location shows a list of all items from the events table that corresponds to that location.
